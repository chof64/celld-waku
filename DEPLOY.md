# Deploy Celld

This is the shared Celld production runbook for both [celld-hono](https://github.com/chof64/celld-hono) (API-first, optional React SPA) and [celld-waku](https://github.com/chof64/celld-waku) (full-stack React). Keep the fleet, upgrade, secrets and CI sections aligned in both repositories.

It covers:

1. **Deploy Celld** — single-node and multi-node.
2. **Upgrade Celld** — rolling update or stop-and-update.
3. **Production tuning** — the few settings worth knowing first.

# 1. Deploy Celld

## Container image

Use the official image and pin the version or digest:

```text
ghcr.io/denoland/celld:<PINNED_VERSION>
```

Every node needs:

- persistent storage for `CELLD_WATCH`,
- fleet object-store credentials,
- public Worker listener on `:8080`,
- private Celld listener on `:8081`,
- graceful shutdown time.

This guide assumes containers do **not** use host networking.

The public Worker listener binds inside the container:

```dotenv
CELLD_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
```

The internal listener depends on the topology:

- **single node:** bind to loopback with `127.0.0.1:8081`; no advertise address is needed,
- **multi-node:** bind to `0.0.0.0:8081` and set a private peer-reachable `CELLD_ADVERTISE`.

Leave `CELLD_NODE` unset. Celld generates the node-session ID automatically.

---

## Single-node production

Use this when simplicity matters more than zero-downtime node maintenance.

```text
Internet
   |
Ingress / TLS
   |
Celld
├─ :8080 public
├─ 127.0.0.1:8081 internal only
├─ persistent CELLD_WATCH
└─ fleet bucket
```

### Environment

```dotenv
CELLD_BUCKET=s3://my-celld-fleet
S3_ENDPOINT=https://object-storage.example.com
AWS_REGION=auto

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...

CELLD_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
CELLD_INTERNAL_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8081

CELLD_WATCH=/var/lib/celld/state
CELLD_DURABILITY=bucket
```

No `CELLD_ADVERTISE` is needed because no peer node needs to reach the internal listener. Binding it to loopback also keeps the operator surface inaccessible from the container network.

For a deliberate single-node deployment use:

```text
CELLD_DURABILITY=bucket
```

so acknowledged durable writes wait for the object store.

### Container requirements

- Persist `/var/lib/celld` or whatever contains `CELLD_WATCH`.
- Publish only the public Worker listener through ingress.
- Keep the internal listener on `127.0.0.1:8081`; do not publish it from the container.
- Give the container at least ~90 seconds to stop gracefully with current defaults.
- Supply credentials through the infrastructure/secrets manager.

### Start and deploy

1. Start the Celld container.
2. Wait for:
   ```text
   /.well-known/celld/health
   ```
3. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   pnpm check
   pnpm deploy -- --dry-run
   pnpm deploy
   ```

The node and deploy process must use the same `CELLD_BUCKET`.

---

## Multi-node production

Use this for higher availability, maintenance without full downtime, and lower durable-write latency.

```text
                       fleet bucket
                           |
              +------------+------------+
              |            |            |
           Celld A      Celld B      Celld C
           :8080        :8080        :8080
           :8081        :8081        :8081
              ^            ^            ^
              +------------+------------+
                    private network
                           ^
                           |
                     public ingress
```

All nodes use the same:

```text
CELLD_BUCKET
CELLD_DURABILITY=fleet
```

Each node gets its own:

```text
CELLD_WATCH
CELLD_ADVERTISE
```

### Node A

```dotenv
CELLD_BUCKET=s3://my-celld-fleet
S3_ENDPOINT=https://object-storage.example.com
AWS_REGION=auto

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

CELLD_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
CELLD_INTERNAL_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8081
CELLD_ADVERTISE=celld-a.internal:8081

CELLD_WATCH=/var/lib/celld/state
CELLD_DURABILITY=fleet
```

### Node B

```dotenv
CELLD_BUCKET=s3://my-celld-fleet
S3_ENDPOINT=https://object-storage.example.com
AWS_REGION=auto

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

CELLD_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
CELLD_INTERNAL_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8081
CELLD_ADVERTISE=celld-b.internal:8081

CELLD_WATCH=/var/lib/celld/state
CELLD_DURABILITY=fleet
```

Additional nodes follow the same pattern.

The advertised hostnames must resolve between nodes on the private network.

Celld discovers peers from leases in the fleet bucket; there is no join command or peer list.

Reference: [Add nodes](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#add-nodes)

---

## Object storage

All nodes and `celld deploy` must use the same fleet bucket or prefix.

### S3-compatible example

```dotenv
CELLD_BUCKET=s3://my-celld-fleet
S3_ENDPOINT=https://ACCOUNT.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
AWS_REGION=auto
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

For AWS S3, `S3_ENDPOINT` is normally unnecessary.

Celld also supports Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage.

Reference: [Configure object storage](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#configure-object-storage)

---

## Deploy the application

Deploy **once per fleet**:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

```text
pnpm deploy
    |
celld deploy
    |
fleet deployment pointer
    |
+---+---+
|       |
A       B       ...
```

Do not deploy application code node-by-node.

**One fleet runs one composed Celld application.** These starter workflows are intended for standalone deployments. Give each standalone deployment its own fleet/bucket. To co-host Hono and Waku Workers in one fleet, compose both Worker scripts under a single application deployment and publish it from **one deployment pipeline** (such as the planned `xicar-ph/celld` repository). Disable independent repository deployment workflows targeting that shared fleet; publishing one starter by itself would replace the current application pointer rather than merge it.

Running nodes poll the deployment pointer and adopt the new application in place.

Serialize production deploys so only one writer updates a fleet at a time.

Reference: [Deploy an application](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#deploy-an-application)

### GitHub Actions

The boilerplate includes `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

It deploys on pushes to `main` and can also be started manually from `main` with `workflow_dispatch`. Production runs are serialized **within each GitHub repository** using Actions concurrency. GitHub's concurrency groups do not coordinate across repositories. If both starters target the same fleet, use a single composition/deployment pipeline or another fleet-wide deploy lock; never assume these two workflows serialize each other. Restrict the `production` GitHub Environment to deployments from `main` as well.

In the `production` GitHub Environment, configure these variables:

```text
CELLD_VERSION
CELLD_BUCKET
AWS_REGION
S3_ENDPOINT       # omit for AWS S3
```

Set `CELLD_VERSION` to the exact Celld release tag used by the running fleet, such as `v0.1.0`. The workflow requires the variable and installs that release, so update it when the fleet is upgraded.

Configure these secrets on the same GitHub Environment:

```text
ENV_FILE
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN  # optional
```

`ENV_FILE` contains application runtime variables only, as newline-separated `KEY=value` pairs. For example:

```dotenv
GREETING=Hello from production
```

The workflow passes `CELLD_BUCKET`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_REGION`, and the AWS credential secrets directly to the dry-run and deploy steps. For an S3-compatible provider, set its endpoint and region (Cloudflare R2 uses `AWS_REGION=auto`). For AWS S3, omit `S3_ENDPOINT` and use the bucket's AWS region. `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` is optional for temporary credentials.

It normally does **not** need node-only settings such as `CELLD_ADDR`, `CELLD_INTERNAL_ADDR`, `CELLD_ADVERTISE`, `CELLD_WATCH`, or `CELLD_DURABILITY`; those belong on the running Celld nodes.

The workflow:

```text
CELLD_VERSION -> install pinned Celld -> pnpm check -> ENV_FILE -> .env --+
                                                                          +--> dry-run -> deploy
CELLD_BUCKET + S3 settings + AWS credential secrets ---------------------+
```

The deploy wrapper merges `.env` with the process environment and passes the result to Celld. Only variables explicitly declared in `src/env.ts` are copied into Worker bindings. The bucket credentials are available to the deploy CLI and are not written into `.env` or exposed as Worker bindings.

The workflow runs dependency installation and checks before it reads `ENV_FILE`. It then rejects Celld, AWS and S3 infrastructure settings in the file, writes `.env` with restrictive file permissions, and never intentionally prints its contents. The file is already ignored by Git. The S3 credentials are scoped to the deployment steps rather than dependency installation and checks.

To configure the secret with GitHub CLI from a local production env file:

```bash
gh secret set ENV_FILE --env production < .env.production
```

Add the variables and credential secrets through the `production` GitHub Environment settings.

# 2. Upgrade Celld

A Celld runtime upgrade is different from an application deploy.

Before upgrading:

1. Read the release notes for the exact old/new versions.
2. Check whether mixed versions are supported.
3. Choose **rolling update** or **stop-and-update**.
4. Pause application deploys.
5. Preserve the fleet bucket and every node's `CELLD_WATCH`.

Do not assume every Celld release can coexist with the previous one.

References: [Roll out a node](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#shut-down-and-roll-out-a-node) · [Guarantees](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/guarantees.md)

---

## Drain a node

For a multi-node fleet, you can explicitly start a graceful drain through the private operator API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://celld-a.internal:8081/shutdown
```

Replace `celld-a.internal` with the node's private `CELLD_ADVERTISE` hostname/address.

This starts the graceful ownership handoff. The node becomes unhealthy on:

```text
/.well-known/celld/health
```

so a health-aware load balancer stops routing new public requests to it.

The operator API is unauthenticated and must only be reachable on the trusted private network.

### Preferred platform command

SIGTERM starts the same graceful shutdown/handoff, so in normal container operations it is also valid—and often simpler—to use the platform's ordinary stop command:

```bash
docker stop <celld-container>
```

or the equivalent stop/redeploy action in your orchestrator.

For a **single-node** setup, the internal listener is bound to `127.0.0.1` inside the container, so the normal platform stop/SIGTERM path is the recommended drain command.

Reference: [Celld operator API and graceful shutdown](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#shut-down-and-roll-out-a-node)

---

## Rolling update

Use when the old and new Celld releases are compatible in the same live fleet.

```text
A old   B old   C old
  ↓
A new   B old   C old
          ↓
A new   B new   C old
                  ↓
A new   B new   C new
```

For each node:

1. Confirm the remaining nodes have enough capacity.
2. Drain the node:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://celld-a.internal:8081/shutdown
   ```
   or stop it through the orchestrator, which sends SIGTERM.
3. Let Celld finish handoff and exit.
4. Replace the pinned Celld image.
5. Reuse the same persistent `CELLD_WATCH`.
6. Start the replacement.
7. Wait for `/.well-known/celld/health`.
8. Run `celld diagnose`.
9. Continue to the next node.

A draining node reports unhealthy, so a health-aware load balancer can stop routing new requests to it automatically.

---

## Stop-and-update

Use when mixed versions are not supported.

```text
stop traffic + pause deploys
            |
stop ALL old nodes gracefully
            |
wait for old leases to disappear
            |
preserve/backup bucket + CELLD_WATCH
            |
update all Celld images
            |
start new fleet
            |
health + diagnose
            |
restore traffic
```

Important:

- prevent old images from auto-restarting,
- preserve every node's local state,
- preserve/back up the fleet bucket,
- do not start the new fleet until old writers are gone.

For a single-node deployment this is naturally the upgrade strategy, with one node.

---

## Graceful shutdown

Celld handles SIGTERM/SIGINT gracefully.

Important setting:

```text
CELLD_SHUTDOWN_TOTAL_MS
```

Current default:

```text
40000 ms
```

The platform stop grace must be longer than this.

A ~90 second stop grace is a reasonable baseline with the current default.

---

# 3. Production tuning

Start with Celld defaults. Tune only when needed.

## Durability

Single node:

```dotenv
CELLD_DURABILITY=bucket
```

Multi-node:

```dotenv
CELLD_DURABILITY=fleet
```

Fleet durability can acknowledge after a follower fsync instead of always waiting for the object-store round trip.

Reference: [Testing and performance notes](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/testing.md)

---

## Memory

Useful limits:

```text
CELLD_MAX_RSS_MB
CELLD_MAX_RESIDENT_CELLS
```

Celld already performs memory-pressure shedding; do not disable it casually.

Reference: [Environment variables](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#environment-variables)

---

## Idle eviction and balancing

Optional:

```text
CELLD_IDLE_EVICT_S
```

This hibernates idle resident cells after the configured age.

It can also make fleet balancing more effective because hibernated cells can move between nodes.

For differently sized nodes:

```text
CELLD_PLACEMENT_WEIGHT
```

Celld otherwise derives placement weight from CPU capacity.

Reference: [Cell lifecycle](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#cell-lifecycle)

---

## Deployment polling

```text
CELLD_DEPLOY_POLL_S
```

Current default:

```text
30 seconds
```

Usually leave this at the default.

Lower values make application deployments propagate faster but increase bucket polling.

---

## Telemetry

Bucket-backed telemetry:

```dotenv
CELLD_OTEL=1
```

OTLP collector:

```dotenv
CELLD_OTEL=http://collector:4318
```

Reference: [Telemetry](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/telemetry.md)

---

## LTX cleanup

Superseded LTX epochs are retained by default.

Optional epoch GC:

```text
CELLD_LTX_RETENTION_SECS
```

Inspect candidates first:

```bash
celld cell gc --dry-run
```

Enable retention only after reading the compatibility/retention notes for the Celld release you run.

Reference: [Epoch GC](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/guarantees.md#epoch-gc)

---

## Health and diagnostics

Health:

```text
/.well-known/celld/health
```

Diagnostics:

```bash
celld --version
celld diagnose
celld cell list
```

Reference: [Diagnose a fleet](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/README.md#diagnose-a-fleet)

---

# Production checklist

- Pin the Celld version/image.
- Persist `CELLD_WATCH`.
- Single node: internal listener `127.0.0.1:8081`, no `CELLD_ADVERTISE`.
- Multi-node: internal listener `0.0.0.0:8081` plus a private `CELLD_ADVERTISE`.
- Never use `0.0.0.0` as `CELLD_ADVERTISE`.
- Leave `CELLD_NODE` unset by default.
- Single node: `CELLD_DURABILITY=bucket`.
- Multi-node: `CELLD_DURABILITY=fleet`.
- Deploy the application once per fleet.
- Serialize application deploys.
- Drain with `POST /shutdown` on the private listener or use the platform's normal SIGTERM stop.
- Use `POST /shutdown` only from the trusted private network.
- Rolling upgrade only when releases are compatible.
- Otherwise stop the old fleet before starting the new version.

# Waku compatibility checklist

Waku's Cloudflare build uses an additional-module model that Celld's prebundled `no_bundle` deploy does not automatically support. The `scripts/package.ts` bridge to `dist/celld/worker.mjs` is **experimental**. The canonical root Wrangler config points to Waku's source entry for the Cloudflare Vite plugin; a derived and ignored `.wrangler.celld.jsonc` points to the bundled Worker and drops unsupported Wrangler `ESModule` rules. Do not deploy this starter to production until all of the following pass using pinned Waku, React and Celld versions:

1. `pnpm build:celld` emits one server JavaScript entry with no unresolved sibling JS imports and generates `.wrangler.celld.jsonc`.
2. `pnpm dev:celld` starts on a real Celld runtime without module-resolution, AsyncLocalStorage or streaming errors.
3. `GET /` returns a server-rendered chat with initial Hono room history, serves its CSS and React client scripts, and hydrates the interactive chat.
4. `GET /rooms/drivers` loads that room's SSR history independently of `/rooms/dispatch`; invalid room IDs render a not-found response.
5. `GET /api/health`, `GET /health`, and `GET /api/rooms/lobby/messages` return JSON rather than frontend asset fallbacks.
6. Two browsers open WebSockets at `/api/rooms/lobby/socket`. Sending via the **Waku Server Action** broadcasts one saved message without duplicated sender UI.
7. Reconnect after temporarily stopping Hono; WebSocket 101 tunneling and subsequent history re-sync recover missed messages.
8. RSC streaming, navigation and hydration remain correct under concurrent requests, and the app shows a visible connection error when chat is unavailable.
9. A deploy/redeploy and graceful Celld node restart do not break routing, client scripts, or realtime reconnection.
10. A configured `CHAT_SERVICE` service binding reaches the Hono/DO Worker without exposing the internal Worker to the browser.

A successful TypeScript check, build, or `celld deploy --dry-run` is not runtime proof. See [Celld compatibility](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/cloudflare-compat.md), [prebuilt Worker restrictions](https://github.com/denoland/celld/blob/main/docs/wasm.md), and [Waku Cloudflare guide](https://waku.gg/guides/cloudflare).

The Waku repository still needs a committed pnpm lockfile following a verified install; its workflow temporarily uses a non-frozen install. Restore `--frozen-lockfile` and pnpm setup-node caching in that repository to match the Hono workflow after committing the lockfile.
